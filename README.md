The project was completed using C++ language. It was a console based game in which the final outcome of the player/game was decided based on certain conditions.
Basically in this game, a man has to run out of the island by collecting coins to buy a boat. Each 10 days can have different weather.
This project helped us in developing a better understanding of conditional statements and logics. It also enabled us to use our theoratical knowledge of loops, functions and conditional statements to convert into useful projects.
